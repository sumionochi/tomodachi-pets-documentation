# Tomodachi Pets: How We Built an AI-Powered On-Chain Virtual Pet Simulator on Sui

**Tomodachi Pets** isn‚Äôt your ordinary NFT app. It‚Äôs a **full-stack, on-chain, AI-driven virtual pet playground**‚Äîwhere anyone can create, personalize, and show off digital companions that live not only in a wallet, but also right on your browser, following your cursor across the web.  
This post will walk you through the project‚Äôs goals, the tech under the hood, how we used Sui + Move, Walrus, and OpenAI, and why this is the *next evolution* in Web3 games.

## üèóÔ∏è Under the Hood: Project Structure

The project is split into two main parts:

#### 1. Main Web App: [`tomodachi-digital-pet`](https://github.com/sumionochi/tomodachi-digital-pet)

- **Move Contract (`move/sources/game.move`)**: Handles minting, equipping, point rewards, and composability.
- **Next.js Frontend**: Users draw, generate with AI, mint NFTs, do quizzes, and see their pets.
- **API Backend**: Integrates with OpenAI for image gen and Walrus for decentralized storage.
- **React hooks** for live data (pets, assets, scoreboard).
- **All game logic enforced on-chain.**

#### 2. Browser Extension: [`tomodachi-digital-pet-extension`](https://github.com/sumionochi/tomodachi-digital-pet-extension)

- **Popup UI**: Enter wallet address, choose pet, manage assets.
- **Background Script**: Fetches live data from local Sui RPC API.
- **Content Script**: Renders your animated pet and its gear as a floating overlay‚Äîfollowing your cursor on every site.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Deep Dive

### Smart Contracts (Move)

- **Composable NFTs**: Pets are containers; you equip asset NFTs (hats, wings) to them.  
- **Daily Rewards & Quizzes**: On-chain clock enforces one check-in per day; quizzes are required for rewards.
- **Unique Names, Admin Tools**: Pet names are enforced globally; admin (for testing) can set scores.
- **Events & Ownership**: All actions (mint, equip, unequip) emit events, making it indexable and interactive.

### AI & Image Pipeline

- **Text-to-Image & Sketch-to-Image**:  
  - Type ‚Äúwizard hat‚Äù ‚Üí AI generates a PNG.
  - Draw a rough sketch, give a prompt ‚Üí AI refines it.
- **Walrus Storage**:  
  - All images uploaded to Walrus.
  - Blob IDs and URLs saved in NFT metadata on Sui.
  - No centralized server dependency.

### Browser Extension UX

- **Pet Companion on Every Site**:  
  - Extension fetches your pet + accessories, animates on every page.
  - Accessory spritesheets = walking, eating, or special moves.
  - User can toggle visibility, switch gear live.
