# 🗂️ Project Structure & System Overview

Tomodachi Pets is composed of two tightly integrated repositories:  
the main web application (dApp) and a browser extension for a cross-web pet experience.

## Main Repository: `tomodachi-digital-pet`

</code>
</pre>

**Tech stack highlights:**
- Built with **Next.js 13 (React + TypeScript)**
- Uses Sui SDKs (`@mysten/sui`, `wallet-kit`) for blockchain, **@mysten/walrus** for decentralized storage
- AI image generation via **OpenAI SDK**
- UI/UX with **Radix UI**, **Tailwind CSS**

## Extension Repository: `tomodachi-digital-pet-extension`

<pre>
<code>
tomodachi-digital-pet-extension/
├── src/
│   ├── popup/
│   │   ├── Popup.tsx            # React popup UI for user to enter Sui address, select pet, configure assets
│   │   └── popup.html, popup.css# HTML/CSS for the extension popup
│   ├── background/
│   │   └── background.ts        # Background script: handles messages, fetches pet data via local API
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── content.ts           # Content script: injects pet overlay in pages, animates assets
│   │   └── content.css          # Styles for pet overlay (cursor-following image)
│   └── common/types.ts          # Shared type definitions (Pet, Asset metadata, message formats)
├── backend/
│   └── server.js                # Express server to query Sui RPC for pet/assets
├── icons/                       # Icons for the extension (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
├── manifest.json                # Chrome extension manifest (permissions, content script registration)
├── webpack.config.js            # Build configuration for the extension (bundles content, popup, background)
└── package.json                 # Extension’s dependencies (uses Sui JS client, React)
</code>
</pre>

**Key components:**  
- Popup UI for Sui address, pet selection  
- Background script for RPC data fetch  
- Content script for live pet rendering  
- Local Node/Express backend for blockchain queries (avoids direct RPC from content script)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is composed of several interacting components:  
the user-facing web app, Sui smart contracts, Walrus storage, OpenAI AI services, and the Chrome browser extension.

## 🤖 AI Service Integration (GPT-Image-1 for Accessories)

Tomodachi Pets features **AI-generated art** for pet accessories, making every asset unique and user-driven.

- **Text-to-Image:**  
  Users describe an accessory (e.g., “red cowboy hat with gold trim”), then `/api/generate` uses OpenAI’s GPT-Image-1 to create a 1024×1024 transparent PNG.
- **Sketch-to-Image Editing:**  
  Users can sketch accessory outlines in-app, submit with a text prompt to `/api/editPetPreview`, and AI turns it into polished art—perfect for non-artists.
- **Multi-Image Previews:**  
  `/api/generatePetPreview` fetches several AI variants so users can pick the best.
- **Manual Upload Supported:**  
  Users can always upload their own images—handled by `/api/upload`.
- **Decentralized Storage:**  
  All finalized images are sent to Walrus and referenced in the on-chain NFT.

## 🌐 Browser Extension: Pet Companion Everywhere

Tomodachi Pets' Chrome extension brings your NFT pet (and its accessories) to any website, making Web3 feel alive and fun.

- **Popup UI:** Enter Sui address, pick pet/assets
- **Background script:** Fetches on-chain pet and asset data via local API
- **Content script:** Renders pet overlay, animates assets, follows your cursor on every page
- **User control:** Toggle pet/asset visibility, hotkeys, and more

## 🧑‍💻 User Flows & Journeys

Tomodachi Pets is built for an intuitive, rewarding player experience.  
Typical user journeys:

- **🐣 Creating Your Pet:**  
  New user connects Sui wallet, enters unique name, and calls `create_pet`. If available, the pet NFT is minted and appears in dashboard & wallet.
- **🎨 Designing & Minting Accessories:**  
  User draws or describes accessory, uses AI generation, uploads to Walrus, then mints as on-chain asset NFT (burns points).
- **👒 Equipping Accessories:**  
  User equips asset to pet (`equip_asset`). Pet updates visually both in app and extension overlay. Assets become child NFTs of pet on-chain.
- **📅 Daily Quiz & Check-In:**  
  User completes daily quiz, then claims check-in (+2 points, one per 24h via on-chain Clock logic).
- **🌐 Browsing with Extension:**  
  Pet with all equipped accessories follows user's cursor everywhere online. Users can hide/show pet or switch assets with a hotkey.
