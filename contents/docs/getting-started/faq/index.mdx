# ‚ùì FAQ ‚Äì Tomodachi Pets

Here you‚Äôll find answers to common questions about Tomodachi Pets, gameplay, technology, security, and more.

---

## üéÆ Game & User Experience

### What is Tomodachi Pets?
Tomodachi Pets is an AI-powered, on-chain pet simulator where you can draw or prompt custom pet companions and accessories, mint them as NFTs on Sui, and bring them to life on any website via a browser extension.

---

### How do I start playing?
1. Visit the web app and connect your Sui wallet.
2. Register to claim starting points.
3. Create and name your unique pet.
4. Complete daily quizzes to earn more points.
5. Design and mint custom accessories using AI or your own uploads.
6. Equip accessories to your pet.
7. Install the Chrome extension to see your pet follow your cursor across the web!

---

### Do I need to pay to play or mint pets/accessories?
No, the game is **free to play**. Points are earned through registration and daily engagement (quiz + check-in). Minting an accessory NFT burns in-game points (not SUI tokens), so there's no out-of-pocket cost after you claim your initial points.

---

### What‚Äôs unique about the pets and accessories?
- **Each pet** has a unique on-chain name and NFT ID.
- **Accessories** are fully custom: draw, upload, or use AI to create something new!
- **Pets and accessories are composable NFTs:** you can equip/unequip accessories at any time.
- **All images and metadata are stored in decentralized storage** (Walrus).

---

### Can I have more than one pet?
Typically, each user can mint **one unique pet** per wallet (enforced by the Move contract for gameplay balance). Accessories and assets are unlimited.

---

### What‚Äôs the daily quiz?
A daily, on-chain quiz about Sui, Walrus, Move, and crypto/web3. Completing it unlocks the check-in button, which rewards +2 points if 24 hours have passed since your last claim. It‚Äôs both a reward and a fun way to learn!

---

## üñºÔ∏è NFTs, AI & Decentralized Storage

### How are accessories generated with AI?
Accessories can be created by:
- Describing them with text (e.g., "wizard hat")
- Sketching/drawing with the in-app canvas
- Editing sketches using AI
The app uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-Image-1 for text-to-image and image-editing, then previews results for minting.

---

### Where are my pet and accessory images stored?
Images are uploaded to **Walrus** ‚Äì Mysten Labs‚Äô decentralized storage protocol. Your NFT‚Äôs on-chain metadata contains a Walrus content address (blobId URL).  
Anyone can fetch the image using this URL, making your pet‚Äôs look fully decentralized and censorship-resistant.

---

### Can I upload my own images instead of using AI?
Yes! You can upload PNG/JPG images as accessories, or use your own art instead of AI-generated images. The `/api/upload` route handles both.

---

### Are minted NFTs tradable?
Yes!  
- Accessories are minted as standalone NFTs, tradable/transferrable on Sui.
- Pets themselves are unique NFTs; you own them and can transfer them.
- When equipped, accessories become "child objects" of a pet but can be unequipped and returned to your wallet.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical & Development

### What makes Tomodachi Pets ‚Äúon-chain‚Äù?
- All core game logic (pets, assets, equipping, points, daily rewards, quizzes) is implemented in the **Sui Move smart contract** ([`game.move`](https://github.com/sumionochi/tomodachi-digital-pet/blob/main/move/sources/game.move)).
- Every pet, accessory, and user‚Äôs score is tracked as an on-chain object.
- All asset images are stored via **Walrus** and referenced on-chain.

---

### How does the browser extension work?
- The extension reads your pet and asset NFTs from Sui (using your address).
- Renders your pet and equipped accessories as overlays that follow your cursor on any website.
- All data is fetched via a local backend (`server.js`) that queries Sui and returns the pet/asset data.
- Supports real-time updates, animated sprite sheets, and toggling pets/assets on/off.

---

### What technology stack is used?
- **Frontend:** Next.js 13 (React 19, Tailwind, Radix UI)
- **Blockchain:** Sui + Move contracts
- **Storage:** Walrus Protocol
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-Image-1 (text-to-image, image editing)
- **Extension:** TypeScript, React, Chrome Extension APIs, Node/Express backend

---

### Is the code open source? Can I contribute?
Yes, everything is open source!  
- [Main dApp repository](https://github.com/sumionochi/tomodachi-digital-pet)
- [Browser extension repository](https://github.com/sumionochi/tomodachi-digital-pet-extension)
You‚Äôre welcome to contribute, suggest features, or fork for your own use!

---

## üîí Security & Fairness

### Can someone cheat to claim extra rewards?
No, the daily check-in (and quiz) logic is enforced by the Move contract using Sui‚Äôs global `Clock` object. You can only claim once per 24 hours per wallet‚Äîimpossible to cheat via the UI.

---

### What is the AdminCap?
A special on-chain object, **only given to the deployer**.  
Used to test features (e.g., manually setting a user‚Äôs score for demo/judging). Regular users never have access; all real gameplay is strictly governed by smart contract rules.

---

### Is my pet or asset data safe if Walrus goes down?
Walrus is designed as decentralized, redundant storage‚Äîlike IPFS, but for Sui. Your NFTs‚Äô image links are content-addressed. As long as one Walrus node is live, your images are safe.  
**On-chain metadata is always available**, and images can be re-pinned by anyone if needed.

---

## üåê Miscellaneous

### Can I use Tomodachi Pets on mobile?
The web app is responsive, but full extension support (pet on every page) is currently only for desktop Chrome browsers. All dApp features are mobile-ready otherwise.

---

### Can I export or share my pets?
Yes! Download images directly from the app, share your NFT links, or send/trade pets and accessories via Sui wallet transfer.

---

### How is Tomodachi Pets different from other NFT projects?
- **Playable & interactive:** Pets follow you on the web, not just static images!
- **AI-powered creation:** Anyone can create unique art‚Äîeven non-artists.
- **On-chain composability:** Equip, unequip, and fully own your digital companions.
- **Learning & reward:** The quiz system teaches Web3 while you play.
