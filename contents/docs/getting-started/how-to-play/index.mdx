## 🏅 Bonus Step: Admin Capabilities & Testing Controls

Tomodachi Pets includes **admin-only controls** for testing and hackathon evaluation, made possible with Sui’s Move smart contract permissions.

1. **AdminCap Object**  
   The `AdminCap` is a special object given only to the contract deployer. It allows access to sensitive functions not available to normal users.

<figure>

  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 18:</b> Only the contract deployer receives <code>adminCap</code> to manage scores for any player.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

2. **Score Adjustment Function**  
   With `adminCap`, the deployer can use the `admin_set_score` function to directly set or change a player’s score—useful for testing, onboarding, or correcting demo data.

## 🏅 Bonus Step: Walrus Integration – Decentralized Storage

Tomodachi Pets uses **Walrus** by Mysten Labs for all image storage—making every NFT truly decentralized and Web3-native.

1. **Image Upload**  
   When your accessory or pet image is finalized (drawn, uploaded, or AI-generated), it’s sent to a Walrus Publisher node via the `/api/upload` route as binary data.

<figure>
  <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gr3bkoyWUAAK1z1?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Uploading image to Walrus" />
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 20:</b> Image is converted to binary and uploaded to Walrus Publisher. User receives a <code>blobId</code>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

2. **Content Addressing**  
   Walrus returns a <code>blobId</code> (unique hash for your image). The app forms a URL like:  
   <code>https://blobs.testnet.walrus.network/&lt;blobId&gt;</code>  
   This is stored in the NFT’s on-chain metadata.

3. **On-Chain Reference**  
   When you mint your accessory NFT, the Walrus URL is saved in the `url` field of the Asset object (on-chain).  
   Anyone can retrieve the image from Walrus using this link.

4. **Benefits**  
   - No central server: Images are stored on a decentralized network.
   - Always available: Any user can fetch the image with the link.
   - On-chain ownership: Image link is part of the NFT object itself.

  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 21:</b> Walrus responds with <code>blobId</code>; asset is minted and fully decentralized.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

> **Why it matters:**  
> Walrus makes sure your NFT art isn’t just a pointer on a server or IPFS.  
> Every image is provably linked, censorship-resistant, and always available.  
> **You truly own your Tomodachi Pets and their accessories.**

<Note type="info">
  Each major step is enforced and verified by on-chain smart contracts and decentralized storage for true user ownership.  
  All images and metadata live on Sui + Walrus—<b>no centralized servers!</b>
