<Note>
  **Built for SuiOverflow 2025 (Entertainment & Culture track):** Tomodachi Pets
  showcases Sui‚Äôs on-chain composability in a playful way. The project
  demonstrates how **user-generated content** (your pet drawings or prompts) can
  be turned into **animated NFTs**, and how on-chain game assets can live beyond
  a single dApp.

## Philosophy

- **On-Chain Composability:**  
  Every pet and accessory is a Sui on-chain object. Move contract uses dynamic fields to attach asset NFTs onto a Pet NFT, enabling equipping/unequipping with true ownership (`game.move:L260-L268`).

- **User Creativity & AI:**  
  Users generate custom pet art via AI‚ÄîNext.js API integrates OpenAI image generation to turn text/sketches into images, minted as assets (`api/generate/route.ts:L15-L22`).

- **Daily Engagement & Learning:**  
  Daily Sui, Move, Walrus related Quiz required to claim rewards +2 points. On-chain logic enforces 24-hour check-in intervals; points awarded after quiz (`game.move:L137-L145`, `game.move:L145-L150`).

- **Seamless Web3 Presence:**  
  Chrome extension brings your pet to any website, following your cursor‚Äîextension background fetches live pet data, content script injects visuals (`background.ts:L34-L42`, `content.ts:L256-L264`).

<Note title="Open Source">
  Code, art workflow, and browser extension are fully open source. [GitHub

## Why Tomodachi Pets Should Win (Based On SUI Overflow Hackathon 2025 Rubric)

### üß† 1. Idea / Concept

- **Originality:**  
  On-chain, AI-powered, composable pet NFTs with real browser presence‚Äînot just another DeFi or static NFT app.  
  _Example:_ Equipping a Mario hat to your NFT cat updates both pets and assets directly on-chain, and the pet appears instantly on any website via extension.

  > `game.move:L260-L268`, `content.ts:L256-L264`

- **Meaningful Use Case:**  
  Makes NFTs interactive, personal, and playful‚Äîteaches Web3 via quizzes, not just speculation.  
  _Example:_ User answers a Sui, Walrus, Move contract trivia quiz, then only after completion can click ‚ÄúClaim Daily Reward‚Äù to earn +2 on-chain points used for Asset minting for pets at -10 points.

  > `game.move:L137-L145`, `page.tsx:L1347-L1355`

- **Track Relevance:**  
  Blends gaming, collectibles, user creation, and cultural engagement; perfect for Entertainment & Culture.  
  _Example:_ Users draw or describe unique pets and accessories; AI generates custom art, and each becomes a tradable NFT.
  > `api/generate/route.ts:L15-L22`

---

### üõ† 2. Product

- **Usability & Completeness:**  
  Fully working dApp, browser extension, and backend. All features demo-ready.  
  _Example:_ User creates a pet, equips accessories, sees pet and items live both in app and on any website in real time.

  > `page.tsx:L479-L487`, `server.js:L91-L100`

- **Demo/Prototype:**  
  Users create, mint, equip, animate, and display pets‚Äîevery function works live.  
  _Example:_ Minting a new accessory updates React state and displays the equipped item on the extension overlay.

  > `gameHooks.ts:L279-L287`

- **Intuitive UX/UI:**  
  Aesthetically pleasing Ghibli theme with One-click flows, instant feedback, clear visuals. Pets show up on any site, not buried in wallet.  
  _Example:_ Extension overlay instantly updates when user switches equipped items; users toggle visibility with a simple hotkey.
  > `content.ts:L228-L236`, `background.ts:L34-L42`

---

### üíª 3. Technical Implementation

- **Technical Depth & Complexity:**  
  Advanced Move contract: dynamic fields, global state, trustless cooldowns, event emission.  
  _Example:_ Pet and asset attachment is handled with Sui‚Äôs dynamic object fields‚ÄîMove checks prevent double-equipping and duplicate names on-chain.

  > `game.move:L211-L218`, `game.move:L145-L150`

- **Sui-Native Features:**  
  Uses Sui's unique dynamic fields, global clock, composable objects, and Move-centric logic.  
  _Example:_ Daily check-in uses Sui‚Äôs global Clock object to enforce 24h cooldown; no possible client cheat.

  > `game.move:L260-L268`, `game.move:L137-L145`

- **Thoughtful Architecture:**  
  Modular stack‚ÄîMove, Next.js, AI backend, Chrome extension, and live Web3 hooks all interconnected.  
  _Example:_ When an asset is equipped, the dApp triggers a Move transaction, React state updates, and the extension fetches new data from the backend, syncing UI everywhere.
  > `sui.ts:L123-L132`, `server.js:L98-L106`

---

### üò≤ 4. "Wow" Factor

- **Lasting Impression:**  
  NFT pets visibly follow you across the whole web, not just a dApp.  
  _Example:_ User visits any website‚Äîpet floats beside their cursor, orbiting animated accessories in real time.

  > `content.ts:L256-L264`

- **Clever/Impactful:**  
  Turns NFTs from static images into living, composable companions.  
  _Example:_ Equipping a new accessory triggers live animation frames, making pets ‚Äúwalk‚Äù or ‚Äúeat‚Äù across any website.

  > `game.move:L260-L268`, `content.ts:L228-L236`

- **Excitement to Go Live:**  
  Mainstream-ready, playful, replayable, and instantly engaging for all users‚ÄîWeb3 as it should be.  
  _Example:_ All layers productionized‚Äîpet creation, AI art, instant display, robust error handling, and ready for public use.
  > `page.tsx:L452-L461`, `gameHooks.ts:L263-L270`
